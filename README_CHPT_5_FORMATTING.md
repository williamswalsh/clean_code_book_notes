## Formatting

- Automated tools can apply formatting - completely removing the task
- Consistent formatting aids communication
- Class files should resemble newspapers with headlines, synopsis
- The detail should increase as you go down the file.
- Use white lines to separate complete "thoughts".
- **Conceptual Affinity** - Concepts closely related should be kept close to one another.
  - We want to avoid making the user hop around.
- Variables should be declared as close as possible to their usage.
- Instance variables declared at the top of the file(Java)
- A function that is called should be below the function doing the calling
- Use your Teams coding standard
  - standardise to simplify
  - don't add more complexity by using different schemes
