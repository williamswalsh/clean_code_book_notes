### Introduction
Craftsmanship is made up of 2 parts:
- knowledge
- practice - you must sweat over it and watch yourself fail.

### CHPT 1

- code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.
- One "wades through" bad code.
- LeBlanks Law: Later = never
- Take responsibility for the code - it's not the mgmts fault
- It's your job to defend the code.
- The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible.
- Clean code
  - cared for
  - elegant
  - logic should be straight forward to make it hard for bugs to hide.
  - focussed - no ambiguity
  - no duplication
  - crisp abstractions
  - Expresses the design ideas in the system
  - unit tests - code without tests is not clean code
  - functions turn out to be what you expected - no surprises
  - It's the programmer that makes the language appear simple
  - You are the Author - you sign your name to the code

#### Refactoring Methods
- Parent method saying what the method does
- child methods saying how it is done
